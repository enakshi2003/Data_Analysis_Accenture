I have recently participated in Accenture’s Data Analytics & Visualization job simulation and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture.

1. Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture
2. Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions
3. Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders
